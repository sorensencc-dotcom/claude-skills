### 9 cs-* Agents (in `c-level-agents/agents/`)

Existing `cs-ceo-advisor` and `cs-cto-advisor` live in `/agents/c-level/` and integrate with the same protocol.

### 17 /cs:* Slash Commands (in `c-level-agents/skills/`)

**Forcing-question office hours (8):** `/cs:office-hours`, `/cs:cfo-review`, `/cs:cmo-review`, `/cs:cpo-review`, `/cs:cro-review`, `/cs:cto-review`, `/cs:ciso-review`, `/cs:gc-review`

**Strategic sprint pipeline (5):** `/cs:brief` → `/cs:boardroom` → `/cs:decide` → `/cs:execute` → `/cs:post-mortem`

**Meta + safety (4):** `/cs:founder-mode` (auto-router), `/cs:onboard` (founder interview), `/cs:cross-eval` (multi-model consensus), `/cs:freeze` (cooldown lock)

See [c-level-agents/README.md](c-level-agents/README.md) for the full plugin guide and [c-level-agents/references/persona-voices.md](c-level-agents/references/persona-voices.md) for voice specs.

## Executive Mentor Slash Commands

The only skill with a `plugin.json` (namespace: `em`) because it has slash commands. Other skills are invoked by name through the Chief of Staff router or directly by the user. This is intentional — only add `plugin.json` when a skill has dedicated slash commands that need a namespace.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/em:challenge` | Pre-mortem analysis of any plan |
| `/em:board-prep` | Board meeting preparation |
| `/em:hard-call` | Framework for hard decisions |
| `/em:stress-test` | Stress-test any assumption |
| `/em:postmortem` | Honest retrospective |

## Key Design Decisions

- **Two-layer memory:** Raw transcripts (reference) + approved decisions only (feeds future meetings). Prevents hallucinated consensus.
- **Phase 2 isolation:** During board meetings, agents think independently before cross-examination.
- **Internal Quality Loop:** Self-verify → peer-verify → critic pre-screen → present. No unverified output reaches the founder.
- **Proactive triggers:** Every role has context-driven early warnings that surface issues without being asked.
- **User Communication Standard:** Bottom Line → What → Why → How to Act → Your Decision. Results only, no process narration.

## Python Tools (25 total)
